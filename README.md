# Learning Python the Hard Way But For Real This Time

## What?
| This is reteaching and relearning python with a new toolset that is better designed for modern workflows and efficiencies. Probably still have no idea what I'm doing but we'll get there. 
Key differences are:
* Utilizing Github to store and interact with exercises
* Using Jupyter + VSCode to streamline workflow
* Allow me to work on exercises from any machine with an internet connection.

# Tooling
* VSCode for editing and integration of Jupyter
* Jupyter for access to Kernel and VSCode integration
* Github for file management
